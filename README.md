Pokemon Reset Counter
-----
A GUI program that counts the amount of times someone has reset a Pokemon Game. Has other applications outside of Pokemon.

The default keybinds are: A, S, D, F, G, H

In order to start counting, the "Keyboard Count" button must be checked. 

There is also a "Green Screen" option if you wish to use this as an overlay in OBS. It doesn't look pretty but gets the job done.

Future Plans
-----
* Have a save feature to save current settings in the name and counter.
* Button to split the counter sheets into 2x3 instead of 1x6
* Make custom keybinds save after exiting
